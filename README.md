# udacity_book_listing_app

 Book Listing app is an app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.
 
 As a part of Udacity Nanodegree this app is created for practicing the Networking concepts in Android Mobile apps.
 
 This practice app helped to learn the following:
1) Fetching data from an API using a class such as HttpUriRequest or HttpURLConnection.
2) Using an AsyncTask or AsyncTaskLoader so that the network call occurs off the UI thread
3) Parsing a JSON response
4) Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
5) Providing appropriate messages to user by checking whether the device is connected to the internet or the response id empty.
